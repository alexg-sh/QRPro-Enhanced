## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run on your preferred platform

   ```bash
   # For iOS simulator
   npm run ios
   
   # For Android emulator  
   npm run android
   
   # For web browser
   npm run web
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) with Expo Router.

## Camera Permissions

The app requires camera permissions to scan QR codes:
- **iOS**: Camera access is automatically requested when needed
- **Android**: CAMERA permission is included in the app manifest

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
